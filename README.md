knowledge base on how to read textual contents from different types of documents

## Why text parsing?
The first step in any Natural Language Processing based project is to gather textual contents from different sources. If we have all the textual corpus in .txt extension it is quite simple. However, in different projects, we may have to deal with text files in different extensions. This repo is for mantaining how can we read textual contents from different file extensions efficiently and accurately. 
## Python implementation
Python provides a variety of built-in functions and modules for reading textual contents from different file extensions. One common way to read textual data from a file is by using the built-in open() function, which can take a file name or path and a mode argument as its parameters. The mode argument specifies the access mode in which the file is opened, such as read mode, write mode, or append mode.
